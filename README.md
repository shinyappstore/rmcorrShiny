# rmcorrShiny: Visualize Repeated Measures Correlation with Ease

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/rmcorrShiny](https://shinyappstore.com/a/rmcorrShiny)__

The goal of rmcorrShiny is to compute and visualize repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). Rmcorr is the common within-individual linear association for paired, repeated measures data. Rmcorr is conceptually similar to a null multilevel model: a fixed slope and varying intercept by participant. By definition, a null multilevel model is a fundamental concept in multilevel or hierarchical modeling, often used in the context of social sciences, epidemiology, and various fields dealing with hierarchical or nested data structures. This model serves as a baseline or reference against which more complex models are compared. It assumes that there are no fixed or random effects at different levels of the hierarchy, essentially positing that the outcome variable is not influenced by the grouping structure in the data.
